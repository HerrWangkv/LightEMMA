Driving Intent for frame 26: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to significantly decelerate, reducing its speed from approximately 7 m/s to 2.3 m/s over 3 seconds, with the most recent deceleration being about 1.5 m/s in the last 0.5 seconds. Concurrently, it was following the lane with negligible turning, as indicated by curvature values consistently near zero. Taking into account this previous deceleration which has brought the vehicle to a very low speed, and the current scene where the traffic light is illuminated green and there are no visible obstacles or pedestrians, the ego vehicle should now accelerate. It should accelerate moderately, increasing its speed by approximately 7 to 8 m/s over the next 3 seconds to reach a suitable cruising speed. The ego vehicle should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a straight path with negligible curvature, as the road ahead appears clear and straight.

Driving Intent for frame 36: The ego's previous intent involved significant speed fluctuations, initially decelerating by approximately 1.54 m/s (from 3.87 m/s to 2.33 m/s) over a 0.5-second interval two seconds ago, followed by accelerating by approximately 0.92 m/s (from 3.02 m/s to 3.94 m/s) over the most recent 0.5-second interval. For turning, the ego was predominantly following the lane, exhibiting very slight left turns with a curvature of 0.001 in two of the observed intervals, despite the road having a subtle curve to the right. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the clear road ahead, it should accelerate by approximately 1.0 to 1.5 m/s^2 over the next 3 seconds to reach a more appropriate speed given the current relatively low speed of 3.94 m/s and the absence of obstacles. Concurrently, to follow the visual cues of the road, the ego should initiate a gentle right turn with a curvature of approximately -0.005 to -0.01 to smoothly navigate the subtle curve to the right.

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to accelerate significantly, with its speed increasing from 0.87 m/s to 6.67 m/s over 2.5 seconds, equating to an average acceleration of approximately 2.32 m/s^2. Concurrently, it was following the lane with negligible turning, as indicated by the very small curvature values close to zero. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, it should decelerate significantly in the next 3 seconds, aiming to come to a complete stop before the red traffic light ahead.

Driving Intent for frame 38: The ego's previous intent was to decelerate by approximately 1.01 m/s, reducing its speed from about 7.91 m/s to 6.89 m/s over the last 3 seconds. Despite the road curving towards the right, the ego vehicle was effectively driving straight with a negligible curvature of 0.0 rad/m. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the clear rightward curve of the road with no observed obstacles, the ego should maintain its current speed of approximately 6.89 m/s for the next 3 seconds, as it has recently reduced its speed to navigate the curve, thus neither accelerating nor decelerating further. To safely follow the road and stay within its lane, the ego must initiate a moderate right turn, which will require a negative curvature, to align with the visible curvature of the road.

Scene Description for frame 0: The front-view camera image displays a paved road extending into the distance under a bright, hazy sky with a strong, diffuse light source in the upper center. The road features lane markings consisting of a solid yellow line on the left and a dashed yellow line on the right, which appear to delineate the center of the roadway. Ahead in the distance, three vehicles are observed traveling in the same general direction: a dark vehicle in what appears to be the left lane, followed by a lighter-colored vehicle, and another lighter-colored vehicle further back on the right. No specific movement or stationary status can be definitively determined from a single image, but they appear in a typical traffic flow. On the left side of the road, a sidewalk runs alongside a grassy area lined with numerous tall evergreen trees and multiple streetlights. Faint outlines of buildings are visible through the haze beyond the trees. On the right side of the road, another sidewalk is present, bordered by a large, moss-covered rocky embankment or cliff face, with more evergreen trees visible beyond it. No pedestrians or traffic lights are visible in the scene.

Driving Intent for frame 46: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly and follow the lane. Over the past 3 seconds, the ego's speed decreased from 4.56 m/s to 0.00 m/s. Specifically, it experienced a strong deceleration from approximately 3.00 m/s to 0.55 m/s (a deceleration of about 4.9 m/s²) between 1.5 and 1 second ago, followed by a deceleration of about 1.1 m/s² in the last 0.5 seconds to come to a complete stop. Its curvature remained essentially 0.0 throughout this period, indicating it was following the lane without turning. Taking into account the ego's previous intent of stopping and the current scene where it is already stopped behind a black sedan, with an amber traffic light ahead, the ego vehicle should maintain its speed at 0 m/s for the next 3 seconds, effectively remaining stopped. It should continue to follow the lane with a curvature of 0.0, as the road ahead appears straight and no turning is required.

Scene Description for frame 40: The scene displays a two-lane road with clear broken yellow lane markings separating the lanes for traffic flowing in the same direction, and a solid white line defining the right edge of the drivable surface. An orange compact car is observed directly ahead in the current lane, with its rear visible, while a blue SUV is positioned to its left in the adjacent lane, slightly behind the orange car, with its front visible. Further ahead, several indistinct vehicles are partially visible through a strong atmospheric haze caused by a low sun shining directly forward. Tall evergreen trees line both sides of the road, creating dense foliage. On the right side, a utility pole with a street light arm stands, and large moss-covered rock formations are present beyond the sidewalk. On the left, behind the trees, brick buildings are discernible. No pedestrians or traffic lights are visible in the frame.

Driving Intent for frame 40: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating by approximately 2.4 m/s² and following the lane, as indicated by a consistent increase in speed from 8.04 m/s to 14.02 m/s over the last 2.5 seconds and a negligible curvature of 0.0 for the majority of the period. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, the ego should decelerate by approximately 1.5 to 2.0 m/s² and continue to follow the lane. This is advised because an orange compact car is directly ahead in the current lane, and maintaining the previous acceleration would close the distance too quickly, especially given the strong atmospheric haze and low sun directly forward reducing overall visibility further ahead. The road appears straight, so there is no need for significant steering input beyond maintaining the current lane.

Driving Intent for frame 20: The ego vehicle's previous intent involved significant acceleration during the first 1.5 seconds of the measurement period, increasing its speed from 4.565 m/s to 7.935 m/s. For the subsequent 1.5 seconds, it was largely maintaining speed around 7.9 m/s, with a very slight deceleration of 0.029 m/s occurring in the most recent 0.5-second interval. In terms of turning, the ego was primarily following the lane, exhibiting a brief, slight right turn with a curvature of -0.055 early in the period, which quickly corrected, and then maintained a near-straight path with negligible rightward curvature, averaging around -0.007 in the recent past. Taking into account this previous intent and the current scene, the ego should maintain its speed at approximately 7.9 m/s for the next 3 seconds, as the multi-lane urban road ahead is straight and clear of immediate obstacles in its lane. It should also continue to follow its current lane, as there are no environmental cues to necessitate a turn or lane change.

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily decelerating and following the lane. Over the last 1.5 seconds, the ego decelerated significantly from approximately 2.02 m/s to a near complete stop of 0.000002 m/s, demonstrating a deceleration of about 2.02 m/s. Concurrently, the ego was following the lane, as indicated by a curvature that has been effectively 0.0 for the last 1.0 second, after very minor turning movements earlier. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene where all overhead traffic lights are red and the ego is virtually stopped at an intersection stop line, the ego should maintain its speed at approximately 0 m/s for the next 3 seconds, meaning it should neither accelerate nor decelerate. It should also continue to follow the lane by maintaining a curvature of 0.0, remaining stationary until the traffic lights change.

Driving Intent for frame 28: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to accelerate and follow the lane. For the past 3 seconds, the ego vehicle transitioned from being nearly stopped (speeds close to 0 m/s) to accelerating, reaching a speed of 1.85 m/s at the most recent point. Over the last 0.5 seconds, it accelerated from 0.99 m/s to 1.85 m/s, which indicates an acceleration of approximately 1.72 m/s^2. During this period, the ego vehicle was essentially following the lane, maintaining a nearly straight path with a negligible right turn of -0.001 curvature at the very end. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, it should continue to accelerate and follow the lane in the next 3 seconds. The ego vehicle is currently at a low speed (1.85 m/s) and faces a green traffic signal overhead for the straight-ahead direction. Therefore, it should accelerate significantly, likely at a rate between 1.5 to 2.5 m/s^2, to safely and efficiently pass through the intersection and reach typical urban driving speeds. It should continue to follow the lane by maintaining a curvature of approximately 0, proceeding straight through the intersection.

Driving Intent for frame 44: The ego vehicle was previously accelerating by an average of 1.62 m/s² over the last second, increasing its speed from 2.82 m/s to 4.44 m/s. It was primarily following the lane, but briefly turned right with a maximum curvature of -0.088 m^-1 before almost straightening out to a curvature of -0.004 m^-1 at the most recent point. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the scene, despite the solid white stop line and the red signal on the pole-mounted traffic light to the left, the three overhead traffic lights centrally positioned across the intersection are all green, and a light-colored SUV is already in the intersection, suggesting that through traffic is permitted. Therefore, the ego should accelerate by approximately 1.5 m/s² to clear the intersection and reach an appropriate speed, while continuing to follow the lane with a curvature of 0.0 m^-1 to maintain a straight path.

Driving Intent for frame 20: The ego's previous intent was to accelerate, increasing its speed from approximately 4.55 m/s to 7.89 m/s over the 3-second period, resulting in an average acceleration of about 1.11 m/s^2. Concurrently, it was following the lane, exhibiting a very slight and transient right turn with a maximum absolute curvature of -0.002. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current relatively low speed of 7.89 m/s for a multi-lane road leading into a brightly lit tunnel with no immediate obstacles in its lane, the ego should accelerate by approximately 1.0 m/s^2 to reach a more appropriate speed. Given the straight road and the ego being well within its lane, it should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a negligible curvature of approximately 0.0.

Driving Intent for frame 44: The ego's previous intent was to heavily decelerate from approximately 4.56 m/s to a complete stop of 0.0 m/s over the course of 1.5 seconds, while maintaining its lane with a very minor, transient left curvature of 0.002 briefly. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to stop and the current scene, which shows red traffic lights positioned directly over the main ascending road ahead, the ego should maintain its current speed of 0.0 m/s, effectively maintaining a stop, for the next 3 seconds. It should also continue to follow the lane with 0 curvature, as proceeding forward through a red light is unsafe and illegal, and there is no clear indication or necessity to turn right despite the green light on the far right, which likely applies to a different path.

Driving Intent for frame 46: The ego vehicle was heavily decelerating over the past 3 seconds, slowing from approximately 4.59 m/s to a complete stop of 0.0 m/s, which it maintained for the most recent 1.0 second. During this time, it was following the lane with negligible turning. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, the ego should accelerate from its stopped position and turn right in the next 3 seconds. This is because all traffic signals for proceeding straight or turning left are red, while the separate traffic light on the far right is green, indicating permission to make a right turn.

Driving Intent for frame 12: The ego vehicle's previous intent for speed over the past 3 seconds saw a significant acceleration from 4.69 m/s to 7.93 m/s, with the most recent 0.5 second interval indicating it was accelerating by 0.10 m/s. Regarding turning, the ego was previously turning left with curvature values ranging from 0.04 to 0.102; however, it has been actively reducing its left turn over the last 1.5 seconds, with the most recent curvature measured at 0.04. Taking this previous intent and the current scene into account, the ego should maintain its current speed of approximately 7.9 m/s for the next 3 seconds, as the road ahead appears relatively clear, but reduced visibility due to glare and the uncertain state of the distant sedan and traffic signals make significant acceleration unwise, and there's no immediate need to decelerate. For turning, the ego should follow the lane, aiming to reduce its current slight left curvature further towards zero to maintain a straight path, which is consistent with the visible road geometry.
