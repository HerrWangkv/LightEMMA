Driving Intent for frame 6: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating, increasing its speed from 2.17 m/s to 7.23 m/s over the past 3 seconds, which constitutes an average acceleration of approximately 1.69 m/s², though the acceleration rate decreased in the most recent 0.5-second interval to 0.79 m/s². Concurrently, it was following the lane, exhibiting very minor steering adjustments with curvature values mostly near 0.0 m⁻¹, with the largest deviation being a gentle turn of 0.013 m⁻¹ to the left. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene—a straight multi-lane road with a lead vehicle at a safe distance and no visible pedestrians or traffic lights—the ego vehicle should continue to accelerate over the next 3 seconds. A moderate acceleration of approximately 1.2 to 1.5 m/s² would be appropriate to reach a more suitable speed for the road conditions while continuously monitoring the lead vehicle. The ego vehicle should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of approximately 0.0 m⁻¹, as the road appears straight and no turns are indicated.

Driving Intent for frame 28: The ego's previous intent was to decelerate by approximately 4.24 m/s over the last 3 seconds (from 7.31 m/s to 3.06 m/s) and to turn right by a very small amount, with an average curvature of approximately -0.0015 rad/m, effectively following the lane with a minor right bias. Taking into account the ego's previous intent, it should now accelerate, increasing its speed by approximately 3 to 4.5 m/s over the next 3 seconds, given the green traffic light and clear road ahead. It should also continue to turn right by a small amount, maintaining a curvature around -0.001 to -0.002 rad/m, to proceed through the intersection or follow the gentle right curve indicated by the railing.

Scene Description for frame 30: The scene displays an urban environment dominated by buildings under a clear sky. In the immediate foreground, a broad, light-colored paved surface extends across the image. To the right, this paved surface transitions into a raised curved concrete curb, alongside which a metal railing is installed. In the midground, a narrow commercial building with a light yellow facade and prominent upper-story windows is situated centrally, flanked by larger, multi-story buildings. The building to the left features beige and white sections with multiple rectangular windows, while the building to the right is primarily white with various architectural cutouts and windows. A street lamp pole stands on the left side, extending upwards from the ground level. No vehicles or pedestrians are observed in the visible area, and no lane markings or traffic lights are present on the paved surface. Shadows are cast on the ground, indicating direct sunlight from the left.

Driving Intent for frame 30: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily decelerating, reducing its speed from approximately 7.1 m/s to 3.34 m/s over the last 3 seconds, indicating a net deceleration of about 3.76 m/s. However, in the most recent 0.5-second interval, it slightly accelerated by 0.37 m/s (from 2.97 m/s to 3.34 m/s). Concurrently, the ego vehicle was following the lane, with negligible curvature, essentially driving straight as all curvature values were very close to zero, with a maximum turn of -0.002 (a slight right). Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the clear, unobstructed urban environment with a broad paved surface ahead, the ego should accelerate moderately in the next 3 seconds, for instance, by approximately 1.0 m/s^2, to reach a more appropriate speed for the environment (e.g., around 6.34 m/s by the end of 3 seconds). It should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of 0.0, as the path ahead appears straight and clear of any turns or immediate hazards.

Driving Intent for frame 2: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, dropping from 3.986 m/s to 0.378 m/s over the last 1.5 seconds. In the most recent 0.5-second interval, it decelerated by approximately 2.685 m/s, indicating an average deceleration of about 5.37 m/s². Concurrently, it was largely following the lane, but made a slight right turn with a curvature of -0.019 at t-1.0s, before almost straightening to a very slight right turn of -0.003 in the most recent interval. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the red traffic light directly ahead, combined with the presence of a pedestrian crosswalk and other stopped or slowly moving vehicles, the ego should continue to decelerate to a complete stop (0 m/s) over the next 0.5 to 1 second. This will be a gentle deceleration from its current low speed, by approximately 0.4 m/s. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a straight path with zero curvature, as there is no indication to turn.

Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current urban road scene with a red car ahead and a gentle right-hand curve, the ego should accelerate gently by approximately 2.25 m/s over the next 3 seconds (an average acceleration of 0.75 m/s²) to safely match the flow of traffic or resume an appropriate urban speed while maintaining a safe following distance from the lead red car. Concurrently, it should initiate a gentle right turn with an average curvature of approximately -0.02 radians/meter to follow the natural curvature of the road and maintain its position within the lane.

Driving Intent for frame 28: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, reducing its speed from approximately 2.19 m/s to virtually 0 m/s, effectively coming to a near stop. This represents an average deceleration of about 0.876 m/s² over 2.5 seconds. During this period, the ego vehicle was following the lane, as indicated by a curvature of 0.0 or very close to it, meaning it was not turning. Taking into account the ego's previous intent of stopping and the current scene with a green traffic light and a lead vehicle ahead, the ego should now accelerate cautiously. It should accelerate gently to approximately 2 to 3 m/s over the next 3 seconds, corresponding to an acceleration of roughly 0.67 to 1 m/s², while maintaining a safe following distance from the Jeep-like SUV directly in front. The ego should continue to follow the lane with no turning, as the road ahead appears straight.

Driving Intent for frame 44: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating, having increased its speed by approximately 1.09 m/s over the last 0.5 seconds, from a near-stationary state. It was primarily following the lane straight, but very recently initiated a very slight turn right with a curvature of -0.002. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to move forward, the presence of a green traffic light would normally indicate permission to proceed. However, the scene also presents a critical "No Entry" sign directly above the green light, and a stationary black SUV directly ahead. Due to the explicit "No Entry" sign, which overrides the permissive green light for safety reasons, and the stationary obstacle ahead, the ego vehicle should decelerate to a complete stop over the next 3 seconds, meaning it should decelerate by approximately 1.44 m/s. It should also continue to follow the lane straight with a curvature of 0, as there is no indication for a safe turn or lane change given the prohibitory sign and the stationary vehicle in its current lane.

Scene Description for frame 0: The camera captures a brightly lit street scene under a hazy sky with strong glare originating from the upper center. A yellow sedan is prominently positioned in the foreground, slightly to the left, appearing to float above the road surface. Further ahead in the same lane, a dark sedan is visible from the rear, also seemingly elevated. To the far left, another dark sedan is partially obscured by trees and the foreground vehicle. The road features a solid yellow lane marking on the left and a broken yellow line further down on the right side, along with some less distinct markings on the asphalt surface. On the right side of the road, a sidewalk is present, bordered by a curb, and a circular speed limit sign indicating "20" is clearly visible on a pole. Another circular sign, possibly a "no entry" or similar regulatory sign, is visible in the distance on the right. Buildings line the street in the background on both sides, and numerous trees and utility poles are also part of the environment. No pedestrians or active traffic lights are observed in the frame.

Driving Intent for frame 2: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating significantly, with its speed increasing from 1.31 m/s to 7.08 m/s over the past 2.5 seconds, reflecting a recent acceleration of approximately 3.68 m/s^2 (1.84 m/s increase in the last 0.5s). Concurrently, it was following the lane, exhibiting extremely minor steering adjustments with curvature values consistently near zero, the most recent being a negligible 0.001 (slight left). Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current environment, the vehicle should decelerate and continue to follow the lane in the next 3 seconds. It is currently exceeding the posted speed limit of "20" (20 km/h or 5.56 m/s) with a speed of 7.08 m/s and has a lead dark-colored sedan directly ahead. Therefore, the ego should decelerate by approximately 1.5 to 2 m/s over the next second to reduce its speed to be at or below the 20 km/h limit and to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front. It should continue to follow the lane, as the road appears straight and there is no indication for any significant turn or lane change.

Driving Intent for frame 14: The ego vehicle's previous intent involved significant acceleration, increasing its speed from 3.445 m/s to 7.845 m/s over the 3-second period. In the most recent 0.5-second interval, it slightly decelerated by approximately 0.37 m/s². Concurrently, it was following the lane, maintaining a near-zero curvature, with only a negligible 0.001 positive curvature (slight left turn) for a brief moment before returning to straight. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, in the next 3 seconds, the ego should decelerate by approximately 0.5 m/s² to maintain a safe following distance from the leading dark grey sedan and to safely navigate the upcoming right curve and the potential implications of the partially obscured circular red and white traffic sign. The ego should turn right to follow the road's curvature, applying a sustained negative curvature, for example, around -0.02 rad/m, to smoothly traverse the bend.

Driving Intent for frame 16: The ego's previous intent was accelerating, increasing its speed by approximately 4.15 m/s over the past 3 seconds, which translates to an average acceleration of about 1.38 m/s^2. It was following the lane, as indicated by the negligible curvature values, which were predominantly 0.0. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the scene, the ego should maintain its speed for the next 3 seconds, aiming for an average acceleration of 0 m/s^2, to smoothly transition into the upcoming curve. The road ahead curves to the right, and another vehicle is already navigating it, so the ego should turn right with an average curvature of approximately -0.02 m^-1 to follow the lane. This assumes the circular regulatory sign (red with a white horizontal bar) on the right side of the road does not apply to the ego's current path, but potentially to a side entrance or specific lane.

Driving Intent for frame 12: The ego vehicle was accelerating, increasing its speed from approximately 1.08 m/s to 6.39 m/s over the last 2.5 seconds, which averages to an acceleration of about 2.13 m/s², with a more recent acceleration of about 3.68 m/s² in the last 0.5 seconds. For turning, it was initially straight or turning slightly right, then initiated a left turn with a curvature of 0.057 to follow the road's curve, and is currently following the lane with a very gentle left turn (curvature 0.004). Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, it should accelerate by approximately 2 m/s² in the next 3 seconds to reach a more appropriate speed for the urban environment, while maintaining a safe following distance from the lead sedan. It should continue to turn left by following the lane, with a moderate curvature to navigate the visible left-curving road, potentially increasing the curvature slightly from its most recent value to accurately track the lane.

Driving Intent for frame 4: Over the past 3 seconds, the ego vehicle was primarily accelerating, increasing its speed from approximately 2.69 m/s to 7.71 m/s over the first 2.5 seconds of the recorded period, which is an acceleration of about 5.02 m/s. In the most recent 0.5-second interval, it slightly decelerated by 0.08 m/s, effectively maintaining its speed at approximately 7.63 m/s. During this entire period, the ego vehicle was following the lane straight, as indicated by its negligible curvature values of 0.0 or -0.0. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene with a white SUV ahead in the current lane, the ego vehicle should moderately decelerate by approximately 0.75 m/s over the next 3 seconds to ensure a safe following distance. It should continue to follow the current lane straight, as there are no indications for turning and the lane path appears clear.

Driving Intent for frame 12: The ego vehicle's previous intent for speed was to accelerate, increasing its speed from 4.05 m/s to 7.75 m/s over the past 3 seconds, averaging an acceleration of approximately 1.23 m/s². However, in the most recent second (from 1.5 seconds ago to 0.5 seconds ago), the speed fluctuated from 7.94 m/s to 7.48 m/s, then to 7.75 m/s, resulting in a slight net deceleration of approximately 0.19 m/s over that one-second period, suggesting an attempt to maintain speed around 7.7 m/s after an initial strong acceleration. The ego's previous intent for turning was to follow the lane, as indicated by its curvature remaining at 0.0 throughout the past 3 seconds. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, the ego should decelerate in the next 3 seconds. A significant deceleration of approximately 2.5 m/s² is required to safely manage the presence of the white SUV directly ahead, which appears stationary or moving slowly, to prevent a collision or establish a safe following distance. The ego should continue to follow the lane in the next 3 seconds, as the road appears straight and there is no immediate indication or safe opportunity to turn or change lanes, given the adjacent obstacles and road configuration.

Driving Intent for frame 38: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily decelerating, reducing its speed significantly from approximately 4.8 m/s to a complete stop (effectively 0 m/s) over the past 2.5 seconds, with a substantial deceleration of around 4.6 m/s from 2 seconds ago to 1 second ago. Concurrently, it was mostly following the lane, with a brief slight right turn indicated by a curvature of -0.063 approximately 1 second ago, before straightening out and coming to a halt. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, all overhead and distant traffic lights are red, and the ego vehicle is currently stopped at the white solid stop line. Therefore, in the next 3 seconds, the ego vehicle should maintain its current speed (0 m/s) and continue to follow the lane (0 curvature), remaining stationary at the stop line until the traffic lights change to green.

Driving Intent for frame 46: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate, with its speed decreasing from 5.709 m/s to 2.925 m/s over the past 3 seconds, representing an average deceleration of approximately 0.93 m/s^2. Concurrently, it was following the lane, maintaining negligible curvature, with values consistently near 0. Taking this previous intent into account, and observing the stationary yellow sedan directly ahead at an intersection with a green light where all visible vehicles are stationary, the ego should continue to decelerate significantly in the next 3 seconds to safely come to a complete stop behind the yellow sedan. This would involve decelerating by approximately 1.5 to 2.0 m/s^2 to reach 0 m/s within the next 2 seconds and then maintaining a stationary position. Furthermore, the ego should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of approximately 0, as there is no immediate indication to initiate a turn.

Driving Intent for frame 10: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate strongly and come to a stop, while primarily following the lane. Specifically, it decelerated by approximately 4.0 m/s² from 2.0249 m/s to essentially 0 m/s over the first 0.5 seconds of the recorded period, and maintained this near-zero speed afterward. Its turning intent was a very slight right turn with a curvature of -0.001 to -0.002 for the first second, then it straightened to follow the lane with a curvature of 0 for the most recent 1.5 seconds. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, as both traffic lights are red and the vehicle is already stopped at the stop line, it should maintain speed at 0 m/s, meaning it should not accelerate or decelerate further. It should also continue to follow the lane with a curvature of 0, as there is no indication for a turn and it is currently positioned straight at the intersection.

Driving Intent for frame 30: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to accelerate from a near-stop. It was largely stationary for the first 1.5 seconds, then significantly accelerated over the last 1.5 seconds, increasing its speed from approximately 0.21 m/s to 2.17 m/s. The most recent acceleration was an increase of 0.82 m/s over 0.5 seconds (approximately 1.64 m/s^2). Simultaneously, the ego vehicle was primarily following the lane, exhibiting a very slight right turn with a curvature of -0.008, which then decreased to -0.001 in the most recent 0.5-second interval, indicating minor lane adjustments rather than a deliberate turn. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the scene, where traffic lights show green and no immediate obstacles are present, the ego should continue to accelerate. It should accelerate by approximately 1.5 to 2.0 m/s^2 for the next 3 seconds to reach a suitable urban cruising speed. Concurrently, the ego should continue to follow the lane straight through the intersection, as the road appears straight ahead and past curvature was negligible, only making minor steering adjustments if necessary.

Driving Intent for frame 42: The ego's previous intent was accelerating by approximately 1.9 m/s² and following the lane with a very slight right tendency (curvature of -0.003). Taking into account this intent and the current scene, the ego should continue to accelerate by approximately 0.5 m/s² to increase its speed from its current low value, considering the green traffic lights and the need to navigate the upcoming right turn. Despite the painted left-turn arrow visible on the road surface, the ego should prioritize following the physical lane defined by the solid white line on its right edge, which curves to the right; therefore, it should turn right, increasing its rightward curvature from -0.003 to approximately -0.15 to smoothly navigate the bend, while remaining aware of the distant vehicles with illuminated taillights indicating potential congestion beyond the overpass.

Scene Description for frame 42: The scene displays an urban roadway under a dark, overcast sky. In the immediate foreground, a wide grey asphalt road features a thick white stop line extending across its width, with additional parallel white lines further forward on the right side. The road ahead ascends a moderately steep incline, marked with double solid yellow lines in the center and white dashed lines separating two visible lanes. On the left, multi-story red-brown buildings with white windows line the street, while a large light-colored concrete wall, partially covered by tree shadows, runs along the right side of the ascending road, with a tall building visible beyond it. Traffic light assemblies are present in the foreground on both the left and right, both displaying a green signal. Further up the hill, at the crest, a set of traffic lights is visible with the central and flanking lights all illuminated red. No vehicles or pedestrians are present on any visible road sections. A small, indistinct, colorful object is visible at the very top of the hill in the center of the road. Streetlights are visible on poles on both sides of the roadway.

Driving Intent for frame 10: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily to decelerate significantly from approximately 3.15 m/s to a near-complete stop of 0 m/s over a period of about two seconds, then it maintained a stopped speed for one second, and has just begun to accelerate very slightly by 0.005 m/s in the most recent 0.5-second interval. For turning, it was predominantly following the lane, exhibiting a brief and very slight turn to the right with a curvature of -0.003 around 1.5 seconds ago, but has been traveling straight (curvature 0) for the last second. Taking into account the ego's previous intent of coming to a stop at the "STOP" markings and its current near-standstill state, coupled with the observation that the vehicle ahead is moving, the ego vehicle should now accelerate to proceed. It should accelerate by approximately 4.5 m/s over the next three seconds, assuming a comfortable acceleration rate of about 1.5 m/s^2 to regain a driving speed. For turning, it should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of 0 as the road appears straight ahead.

Driving Intent for frame 16: The ego's previous intent was initially decelerating from approximately 1.0 m/s to a full stop, maintaining a stopped position for about 1 second, and then accelerating from 0.0 m/s to 1.12 m/s, with the most recent acceleration being approximately 2.07 m/s². Concurrently, for steering, the ego was following the lane, maintaining a straight path (curvature around 0.0), but has just initiated a very slight turn to the right with a curvature of -0.031. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the observed scene where the leading yellow vehicle is already moving past the stop line, the ego should continue accelerating by approximately 1.5 to 2.0 m/s² over the next 3 seconds to reach a suitable urban speed while maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. For steering, the ego should primarily follow the lane, which appears to proceed straight or with a very gentle curve to the right, maintaining a curvature close to its current -0.031 or straightening to 0.0 as appropriate for the lane geometry.

Driving Intent for frame 2: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating, increasing its speed from approximately 3.5 m/s to 8.0 m/s over 2.5 seconds, corresponding to an average acceleration of about 1.81 m/s². Concurrently, it was turning left with an increasing curvature, from 0.015 to 0.102, indicating a gradual and tightening leftward path. Taking into account its previous intent and the current scene, the ego vehicle should decelerate significantly in the next 3 seconds to come to a complete stop before the solid white stop line, as the traffic light displays a red signal for both the straight-ahead direction and a red left-turn arrow. This would require an average deceleration of approximately 2.68 m/s² to stop from 8.0 m/s within 3 seconds. The ego vehicle should maintain its current lane and follow the lane markings as it decelerates towards the stop line, rather than increasing its turn, to ensure a controlled stop.

Double solid yellow lines delineate the center of the road ahead, with a solid white line on the right separating the current lane from the curb. A dark sedan is stationary directly ahead in the same lane, positioned at an intersection. Overhead, multiple traffic lights are visible, with the primary signal for the current lane displaying a red indication. Streetlights are mounted on poles and overhead gantries lining the road. Buildings of varying heights and styles are present on both the left and right sides of the street. A yellow vehicle is parked or stopped along the right curb near the intersection, with another dark vehicle positioned behind it. Additional vehicles can be faintly seen in the distance on cross streets or further down the main road. No pedestrians are visible.

Previous Curvatures for frame 46: [0.011, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Driving Intent for frame 46: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to maintain speed with a slight deceleration of approximately 0.047 m/s over the past 3 seconds, as its speed decreased from 7.912 m/s to 7.865 m/s. Simultaneously, it was transitioning from a slight left turn with a curvature of 0.011 to following the lane straight, registering zero curvature in the most recent 1.5 seconds. Taking into account the red traffic light ahead and the stationary dark sedan in the current lane at the intersection, the ego vehicle should decelerate significantly by approximately 7.86 m/s over the next 3 seconds to come to a controlled stop behind the lead vehicle. Concurrently, it should continue to follow the lane straight with zero curvature, as there is no indication for a turn.

Scene Description for frame 48: The scene displays an urban intersection under hazy or overcast conditions. A dark colored sedan is stopped directly ahead in the lane, with double solid yellow lines marking the center of the road and a solid white line on the right shoulder. Overhead, the primary traffic light for the current lane of travel is illuminated red, with multiple other traffic lights visible at the intersection, some also appearing red. A yellow sedan is visible to the right at the intersection, partially obscured by a pole, and another light-colored vehicle is further down the road ahead. Buildings line both sides of the street, including a prominent white building on the left. No pedestrians are observed in the image.

Driving Intent for frame 48: The ego's previous intent was decelerating by approximately 0.245 m/s over the last 0.5 seconds, following a period of largely maintained speed, and it was following the lane, having straightened out from a very slight left turn with zero curvature for the most recent 1.5 seconds. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the critical observation of a red traffic light for the current lane and a stopped vehicle directly ahead at the intersection, the ego should decelerate significantly to come to a complete stop behind the lead vehicle within the next 3 seconds, while continuing to follow the lane.
