Scene Description for frame 0: The scene displays a multi-lane road ahead, with a dashed white line separating lanes in the center and a solid white line marking the right edge of the pavement. The road appears to curve slightly to the left further ahead. On the right side of the road, a sidewalk runs parallel to the curb, featuring a street light pole with a decorative base, a dark rectangular sign, and a large blank billboard-like sign further down. A traffic light showing a blue light is visible on a pole above the dark rectangular sign. Several tall evergreen trees are present along the right side of the road and in the middle ground, extending across the scene. On the left side, there is also a sidewalk with a metal barrier and another street light pole. A large, possibly constructed, rock face or barrier with some vegetation rises in the left background. No vehicles or pedestrians are visible in the immediate vicinity or further down the road. The sky is bright with some faint clouds, suggesting daylight conditions, and some structures are visible in the far background.

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego vehicle was previously accelerating by an average of approximately 2.33 m/s² over the past 3 seconds, increasing its speed from 0.83 m/s to 6.64 m/s. During this period, it was following the lane with negligible turning, as indicated by curvature values very close to zero, with a maximum absolute curvature of 0.003. Taking into account the clear multi-lane road ahead with no visible vehicles or pedestrians, the blue traffic light likely indicating permission to proceed, and the road appearing to curve slightly to the left further ahead, the ego vehicle should continue to accelerate by approximately 1.8 to 2.0 m/s² to increase its speed to a more suitable level for the road conditions. Simultaneously, it should begin to gently turn left with a curvature of approximately 0.005 to 0.01 rad/m to follow the natural curve of the road.

Scene Description for frame 4: The scene displays a paved road extending forward, featuring white dashed lane markings that indicate the current lane and potentially another lane or the center of the road further ahead. The road appears to offer a turn or branch to the left while also continuing forward, with a gentle curve to the right in the distance. On the right side, a sidewalk runs parallel to the road, featuring a dark pole, a street lamp, and a white rectangular sign supported by another pole. Beyond these elements, a dense line of evergreen trees is visible. On the left side, there is a sidewalk or paved area bordered by a concrete barrier or wall, beyond which a sloping terrain covered with a structured, possibly protective material and some foliage ascends. Another street lamp is visible on the far left. A traffic light signal on the right side of the road is illuminated with a blue light. The sky above is partly cloudy with soft, warm lighting suggesting either morning or late afternoon. No vehicles or pedestrians are present in the observable area.

Driving Intent for frame 4: The ego's previous intent was accelerating by 5.06 m/s, increasing its speed from 1.85 m/s to 6.92 m/s over the past 3 seconds. Concurrently, it was following the lane with negligible turning, as indicated by curvature values extremely close to zero, ranging from 0.003 (slight left) to -0.002 (slight right), with the most recent curvature being 0.0. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the clear road conditions with a moderate current speed (6.92 m/s), the ego should continue to accelerate by approximately 4.5 m/s over the next 3 seconds to reach a more appropriate cruising speed. Given the blue traffic light is not a stop signal, and the road continues forward with a gentle curve to the right in the distance while also offering a left branch, the ego should continue to follow the lane, adapting to the subtle geometry by anticipating and gradually entering the gentle right curve, implying a very slight and gradually increasing negative curvature.

Scene Description for frame 6: The scene displays a paved road curving to the left, marked by a single dashed white line in the center and a solid white line defining the right edge where it meets a sidewalk. A red traffic light is visible on a pole on the far left side of the road, while another traffic light on a dark square panel on the right side displays a blue light. No other vehicles or pedestrians are present in the immediate view. To the left, there is a large concrete barrier with a rocky, somewhat abstract structure and green foliage beyond it. The background features numerous evergreen trees bathed in warm sunlight under a light, hazy sky. On the right, a large tree with a prominent trunk stands on the sidewalk, with a black utility box or object at its base, and a tall, narrow white sign or banner is partially visible further down the sidewalk. The overall lighting suggests either morning or late afternoon conditions.

Driving Intent for frame 6: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily accelerating by an average of 1.47 m/s² over the past 3 seconds, though it began a slight deceleration of 0.76 m/s² in the most recent 0.5-second interval. It was following the lane, with very minor left adjustments indicated by an average curvature of approximately 0.0025, and ending with a perfectly straight path (curvature 0.0). Taking into account the prominent red traffic light visible ahead, the ego vehicle should decelerate by approximately 2.2 m/s² to bring the vehicle to a complete stop within the next 3 seconds, and continue following the lane straight towards the stop line without initiating the left curve, as proceeding against a red light is unsafe and unlawful, regardless of the ambiguous blue light on the right.

It was following the lane, with a curvature of 0.0 for the last 1.5 seconds. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the ambiguous faint blue light at the intersection which does not indicate a clear "go" signal, the ego should continue to decelerate by approximately 1.5 m/s over the next 0.5 seconds, aiming to come to a full stop within roughly 2 seconds to assess the intersection. The ego should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of 0.0 (straight), as there is no clear indication or requirement to turn right.

Scene Description for frame 14: The front-view camera shows a multi-lane road segment at an intersection or turn-off, under a soft, bright sky. A solid white lane marking is visible on the left side of the current lane, which appears to curve slightly to the left. To the right, another road segment branches off, also curving. A traffic light pole stands on the right side of the road with the top signal appearing blue, while no other signals are clearly identifiable. A sidewalk or curb is present along the right edge of the road, adjacent to the traffic light. No other vehicles or pedestrians are visible in the immediate vicinity. In the background, there is a concrete barrier or median, with a hillside partially covered by what looks like a structural wall and vegetation on the far left. Further back, numerous conifer trees are visible, and behind them, large, light-colored buildings can be seen. A street light pole is also visible towards the left side of the frame.

Previous Curvatures for frame 48: [-0.0, -0.0, -0.0, -0.0, -0.0, -0.0]

Driving Intent for frame 48: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, coming to a near stop from an initial speed of 5.44 m/s to approximately 0 m/s over the past 3 seconds, with an average deceleration of about 1.81 m/s^2. During this time, it was following the lane, maintaining a straight path with 0.0 curvature. Taking into account the ego's previous intent, the current red traffic light, and the stationary vehicle ahead, the ego vehicle should maintain its current speed of 0 m/s for the next 3 seconds, thus neither accelerating nor decelerating. It should also continue to follow the lane, which means maintaining its current straight heading while stopped, as it awaits the traffic light to change and the path to clear before proceeding to follow the lane's curve to the left.

Driving Intent for frame 48: For the past 3 seconds, the ego vehicle was maintaining speed, showing a negligible increase of approximately 0.02 m/s over the period. The ego vehicle was following the lane with an average curvature of 0.0, indicating it was effectively driving straight despite the road ahead clearly curving to the left. Taking into account this previous straight-line driving and the visible left-curving road with reduced visibility due to haze, the ego vehicle should maintain its current speed of approximately 7.9 m/s. To navigate the curve safely and follow the lane, it must initiate a left turn by applying a moderate positive curvature to align with the road's path.

Driving Intent for frame 4: The ego vehicle was accelerating significantly over the past 3 seconds, increasing its speed by approximately 5.95 m/s from 1.78 m/s to 7.73 m/s, with an average acceleration of about 2.38 m/s^2. Its previous turning intent was to follow the lane, as indicated by recent curvature values consistently near zero (0.001 m^-1), after an initial slight left turn (0.077 m^-1) that quickly straightened. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the scene, which shows a straight, two-lane road with a distant vehicle ahead and no immediate hazards, the ego vehicle should continue to accelerate. A moderate acceleration of approximately 1.5 m/s^2, which would result in an increase of roughly 4.5 m/s over the next 3 seconds to a speed of about 12.23 m/s, would be appropriate to reach a more suitable cruising speed. Concurrently, the ego should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of approximately 0.00 m^-1, as the road appears to remain straight.

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego's previous intent was to accelerate significantly, increasing its speed from approximately 0.49 m/s to 6.44 m/s over the last 3 seconds, with an average acceleration of about 2.38 m/s² and a recent acceleration of 3.76 m/s² in the last 0.5 seconds. Concurrently, it was following the lane, exhibiting negligible curvature changes that indicate it was driving essentially straight. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current clear, straight road ahead with no immediate hazards or active traffic controls, it should continue to accelerate at a moderate rate, approximately between 1.5 to 2 m/s², to reach a more appropriate cruising speed. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a straight path with a curvature of 0.0, as the road itself appears straight into the distance.

Previous Curvatures for frame 0: [0, 0.001, -0.001, 0.005, 0.0, 0.0]

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego vehicle was previously accelerating significantly, with the most recent acceleration over the last 0.5 seconds being approximately 3.95 m/s², increasing its speed from 0.674 m/s to 6.538 m/s over the past 3 seconds. Concurrently, it was following the lane, maintaining a near-zero curvature with the last two measurements at 0.0, indicating it was driving straight. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the scene, which shows a multi-lane road with a 90 km/h speed limit and a lead vehicle ahead, the ego should continue to accelerate. Given its current speed of 6.538 m/s (approx 23.5 km/h) is far below the speed limit, it should accelerate by approximately 2.5 m/s² for the next 3 seconds, gradually increasing its speed while maintaining a safe following distance from the red SUV. The road ahead appears straight with no immediate turns, so the ego should continue to follow the lane with 0.0 curvature.

Driving Intent for frame 18: The ego's previous intent was to significantly decelerate and come to a complete stop. It initially accelerated by approximately 1.485 m/s (from 4.334 m/s to 5.819 m/s) between 3 seconds and 2.5 seconds ago. Following this, it decelerated very sharply, reducing its speed by approximately 2.657 m/s between 2.5 seconds and 2 seconds ago, and further by around 3.1617 m/s between 2 seconds and 1.5 seconds ago, finally reaching a near-standstill at 0.000003 m/s at the most recent timestamp. In terms of turning, the ego made very minor adjustments, with a slight turn to the right by up to 0.013 curvature at 1.5 seconds ago, but was following the lane and straightened out to 0.0 curvature as it came to a stop. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to stop and the current red traffic light, the ego should maintain speed at 0 m/s for the next 3 seconds, remaining completely stopped, and maintain its current heading, effectively following the lane without active turning.

Previous Curvatures for frame 44: [0.0, -0.0, 0.0, -0.0, -0.031, -0.007]

Driving Intent for frame 44: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate, specifically by approximately 1.148 m/s in the most recent 0.5-second interval (from 7.303 m/s to 6.155 m/s), following a period of initial acceleration and subsequent slight speed fluctuations. For turning, it was following the lane, exhibiting very minor and decreasing right curvature from -0.031 to -0.007, indicating it was driving mostly straight or making slight adjustments to maintain its path. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to slow down, likely in preparation for the upcoming curve, and the current scene where the road clearly curves towards the left with another vehicle present, the ego should maintain its current speed of 6.155 m/s in the next 3 seconds, as this is a moderate and appropriate speed for navigating the curve safely in an urban environment. Concurrently, it should turn left with a moderate curvature, estimated at approximately 0.08 rad/m, to smoothly follow the visible leftward bend of the road.

Driving Intent for frame 18: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to generally accelerate, increasing its speed from 4.15 m/s to 7.99 m/s over the last 3 seconds. More specifically, in the last second, it decelerated by 1 m/s² then accelerated by 0.5 m/s². Concurrently, it was turning right, with a curvature of approximately -0.126 rad/m one second ago, but has significantly straightened out to almost follow the lane with a curvature of -0.004 rad/m most recently. Taking into account the queued vehicles and traffic cones ahead in the lane, the ego vehicle should decelerate by approximately 2 m/s² over the next 3 seconds to safely approach the obstruction and prepare to stop or match the speed of the slow-moving traffic. It should continue to follow the lane with a curvature of approximately 0 rad/m, as the immediate road ahead appears straight.

Driving Intent for frame 16: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily accelerating, increasing its speed from 3.83 m/s to 7.91 m/s over the 3-second period, representing an acceleration of approximately 4.08 m/s. However, in the most recent second, its speed stabilized, effectively maintaining speed around 7.9 m/s. Concurrently, the ego vehicle was initially turning right with varying intensity, reaching a maximum curvature of -0.127, but then significantly reduced its right turn to transition into following the lane with a curvature of -0.009 in the most recent measurement. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current road conditions, it should accelerate and follow the lane in the next 3 seconds. With the current speed of approximately 7.9 m/s being well below the 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) speed limit and a dark SUV ahead at a safe following distance on a multi-lane, straight roadway, the ego should moderately accelerate by approximately 2.5 m/s over the next 3 seconds to reach around 10.4 m/s. As the road ahead appears straight with no immediate turns indicated and the ego vehicle has just straightened its path, it should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature close to 0.

Driving Intent for frame 18: The ego's previous intent was primarily to accelerate and straighten out. It was accelerating by approximately 0.26 m/s in the last 0.5-second interval. Simultaneously, it was turning right throughout the period, but the magnitude of the turn was steadily decreasing, with the most recent curvature being -0.003, indicating it was essentially following the lane and had almost completed its right adjustment. Taking into account its previous intent and the current scene, the ego should accelerate slightly, by approximately 0.6 m/s over the next 3 seconds (an average acceleration of 0.2 m/s²), to gradually approach the 60 km/h speed limit and maintain a safe following distance behind the dark SUV. The ego should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a near-zero curvature (e.g., between -0.005 and 0.005), as the road ahead appears straight and it has already straightened out from its previous right turn.

Previous Curvatures for frame 40: [-0.0, 0.0, 0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0]

Driving Intent for frame 40: The ego's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, dropping from approximately 3.2 m/s to 0 m/s over the past 3 seconds, effectively bringing the vehicle to a complete stop. During this deceleration, the ego was following the lane with negligible turning, as its curvature remained very close to zero. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene where it is stopped directly behind a stationary silver car, for the next 3 seconds, the ego should maintain speed at 0 m/s to ensure a safe following distance behind the stationary vehicle ahead. It should also continue to follow the lane, which gently curves to the left, indicating it should prepare for or maintain a gentle left turn as the road dictates, once the lead car moves or a safe path forward is available.

Driving Intent for frame 42: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly from approximately 3.15 m/s to a complete stop of 0 m/s over the past 3 seconds, maintaining a speed of 0 m/s for the most recent second. Concurrently, it executed a slight left turn with a maximum curvature of 0.003 at approximately 2 seconds ago, before transitioning to following the lane with 0 curvature for the most recent 1.5 seconds. Taking into account the ego's previous intent, it should continue to maintain its speed at 0 m/s for the next 3 seconds, remaining stopped. This is necessary because the silver car directly ahead has its brake lights illuminated and its left turn signal actively flashing, indicating it is either stopped waiting to turn left or is in the process of a slow left turn, blocking the path. While stopped, the ego should also continue to follow the lane with 0 curvature, maintaining a straight heading, as it awaits the leading vehicle to clear the path.

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego vehicle's previous intent regarding speed was primarily accelerating, with its speed increasing from 0.674 m/s to 4.599 m/s over the first 2.5 seconds of the past 3-second period. However, in the most recent 0.5-second interval, it decelerated by 1.638 m/s, bringing its current speed to 2.961 m/s. For steering, it was mostly following the lane; while there was a more pronounced left turn of 0.05 two seconds ago, the most recent curvature of 0.011 indicates only a very slight left adjustment, essentially maintaining its lane. Taking into account the ego's previous intent, the stationary dark-colored vintage automobile directly ahead, and the illuminated red traffic light, the ego vehicle should decelerate by approximately 2.961 m/s over the next 3 seconds to come to a complete stop behind the lead vehicle. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a straight path behind the vintage car, implying a target curvature close to 0.

Driving Intent for frame 12: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily to decelerate significantly from approximately 2.68 m/s to a complete stop at 0.00 m/s over the last 1 second, with the most recent average deceleration being around 5.35 m/s^2 to reach the current stopped state. Concurrently, it was following the lane, maintaining a negligible curvature of approximately 0.00. Taking into account the ego's previous intent, which led to its current stopped position, and observing the solid red traffic light and the lead vehicle also stopped ahead in the lane, the ego vehicle should maintain its speed at 0.00 m/s for the next 3 seconds, therefore neither accelerating nor decelerating. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of approximately 0.00, as there is no indication for a turn.

Driving Intent for frame 30: The ego's previous intent was maintaining speed, as its speed fluctuated negligibly between 7.788 m/s and 7.907 m/s over the past 3 seconds, resulting in a net acceleration of approximately 0.04 m/s over 3 seconds. Regarding turning, the ego was initially turning left with a peak curvature of 0.093, but gradually straightened out, transitioning to following the lane with a very low curvature of 0.002 at the most recent point. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, it should accelerate by approximately 0.6 m/s over the next 3 seconds to gradually approach the visible speed limit of 60 (presumably km/h, which is 16.67 m/s), as the current speed of 7.907 m/s (28.47 km/h) is well below the limit and there are no immediate obstacles preventing acceleration. The ego should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of approximately 0.000, as the road appears straight ahead.

Driving Intent for frame 48: The ego's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, dropping its speed from approximately 7.9 m/s to 3.57 m/s over the last second, specifically decelerating by about 2.49 m/s between 1.0 and 0.5 seconds ago, and by 1.84 m/s in the last 0.5 seconds. It was following the lane, with a negligible initial left turn, and driving straight with 0.0 curvature for the last 1.5 seconds. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to slow down for the intersection and the SUV ahead, and with the traffic light state indiscernible, the ego should continue to decelerate by approximately 1.2 m/s each second to come to a complete stop behind the SUV within the next 3 seconds. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of 0.0, as the road appears to continue straight through the intersection.

Previous Curvatures for frame 2: [-0.161, -0.0, -0.0, -0.013, -0.009, 0.057]

Driving Intent for frame 2: The ego vehicle's previous intent involved initial sharp deceleration by approximately 1.2 m/s^2 at the start of the 3-second period, followed by consistent acceleration over the last 2.5 seconds, with the most recent acceleration being 1.838 m/s^2. Over the same period, it initially executed a right turn with a curvature of 0.161, then straightened, made slight right turns of 0.013 and 0.009, and most recently transitioned to a gentle left turn with a curvature of 0.057, aligning with the road's described curve. Therefore, the ego was predominantly accelerating and following the lane. Taking into account its previous intent and the scene, which shows a multilane road curving gently left with a lead vehicle moving away and no obstacles or traffic lights, the ego should continue to accelerate. An acceleration of approximately 1.5 m/s^2 over the next 3 seconds would be suitable to smoothly increase the current low speed of 3.59 m/s. The ego should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a gentle left turn with a curvature around 0.057, consistent with the road's geometry.

Driving Intent for frame 22: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating, increasing its speed by approximately 5.27 m/s over the past 3 seconds, from 2.67 m/s to 7.94 m/s. It was following the lane, as evidenced by very small and mixed curvature values ranging from -0.019 (slight right) to 0.057 (slight left), indicating minor steering adjustments within the lane despite the road gently curving to the left. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, it should maintain speed for the next 3 seconds, targeting approximately 7.94 m/s, to ensure a safe following distance from the black sedan ahead which is maintaining its position, especially since the acceleration significantly reduced in the last half-second. Concurrently, it should turn left by following the gentle curvature of the road, which implies a gentle positive curvature, for example, an average curvature of approximately 0.03.

Over the past 3 seconds, its speed decreased from 5.149 m/s to 1.567 m/s, indicating a significant deceleration, particularly a drop of approximately 1.64 m/s in the last 0.5 seconds. The curvature values, which were mostly -0.0, 0.009, 0.005, and 0.007, show that the ego vehicle was following the lane with a very slight, recent tendency to turn left by around 0.007 curvature. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, which includes a dark SUV ahead, clear stop lines for an upcoming intersection, and traffic lights with unconfirmed states, the ego should continue to decelerate to a complete stop. This means decelerating by approximately 1.57 m/s from its current speed to reach 0 m/s within the next 3 seconds to safely approach the intersection. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature close to 0.0, as there are no explicit turn indications and the SUV is directly ahead.

Scene Description for frame 42: The front-view camera shows the rear of a dark-colored vehicle, possibly an older model, with a spare tire mounted on its back and a license plate reading 'VETERAN', positioned directly ahead. The road features white dashed lane markings, a solid white line defining the left edge of the road, and a solid white stop line marking the approach to an intersection. Overhead traffic light signals are present at the intersection, with the primary lights appearing dark or off. To the right, at the intersection, a dark-colored hatchback vehicle is visible, positioned in a lane separate from the ego's path. The surrounding environment includes various urban buildings in the background, some partially obscured by haze, as well as trees, a bus stop shelter on the left, and an overhead bridge or elevated structure spanning the road further down. A distinct building with a cylindrical top is visible to the right of the intersection. No pedestrians are observed in the scene.

Scene Description for frame 44: The front-view camera displays an urban intersection under a hazy sky. Directly in front, the rear of a dark, boxy vehicle is observed, featuring a spare tire mounted on the back and a license plate that reads "GIBBS." The asphalt road ahead shows clear white lane markings, including a solid line on the right defining the curb or turn lane, and dashed lines indicating multiple lanes further back. Overhead, a gantry supports several traffic light heads above the intersection; their illumination state is not clearly visible. To the right, a dark compact SUV is positioned at the intersection, appearing stationary or slowly moving, oriented as if waiting to proceed or turn left. The background reveals a prominent multi-level overpass structure on the right, with various buildings scattered across the skyline, some partially obscured by trees and foliage on the left side where a bus stop shelter is also visible. No pedestrians are present, and all visible vehicles appear to be either stopped or moving at a very slow pace within the scene.

Driving Intent for frame 46: The ego vehicle's previous intent was primarily decelerating, reducing its speed from approximately 3.18 m/s to 0.0007 m/s over the last 1 second, which represents an average deceleration of about 3.18 m/s². Regarding turning, the ego vehicle was mostly following the lane, but showed a recent strong intent to turn left, indicated by a curvature of 0.081 at the most recent timestamp. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and current situation of being nearly stopped at an urban intersection behind another vehicle, with unclear traffic light states and another vehicle already in the intersection, the ego vehicle should maintain its current speed of approximately 0 m/s for the next 3 seconds, meaning it should not accelerate or decelerate further. Furthermore, it should follow the lane by maintaining a curvature of 0, as it is currently stationary and cannot execute any turns until traffic conditions and signals allow it to proceed safely.

Scene Description for frame 20: The front-view camera displays a city street scene at what appears to be an intersection, under bright daylight conditions with a warm light casting on the buildings. In the immediate foreground, the road features a solid white stop line extending across the current lane, with partial white diagonal lines to its right, resembling pedestrian crossing markings. Further ahead, the road appears to divide into at least two lanes, separated by a dashed white lane line. On the left side of the road, a light-colored sedan is positioned, appearing either parked at an angle or slowly moving away from the camera. In the distance, two additional light-colored vehicles are visible, one in the far left lane and another in the far right lane, both indistinct in detail. No pedestrians are observed in the scene. Overhead, a traffic light gantry spans the intersection, with two traffic lights hanging above the lanes; their signal state is not clearly discernible due to distance. Buildings of varying heights and architectural styles line both sides of the street, including multi-story structures on the left with visible balconies and storefronts featuring outdoor seating, and lower residential-style buildings interspersed with larger structures on the right. A prominent large tree with distinct green foliage stands on the right side of the road, partially obscuring a building behind it, with additional hedges and planters visible along the sidewalk. Street light poles and overhead wires are also present in the environment.

Scene Description for frame 22: The front-view camera image displays a multi-lane urban road leading into an intersection under a bright sky, possibly early morning or late afternoon. A prominent white solid stop line stretches across the foreground of the asphalt road, followed by white broken lane markings delineating at least two lanes ahead. Overhead traffic light signals are suspended on a mast arm across the intersection; their lights appear dark or unilluminated, making their current state indistinguishable. On the left side of the road, a light-colored sedan is positioned within the leftmost visible lane, angled as if turning or having completed a turn from the left. Further down the street on the right, another darker sedan is partially visible near the curb, and a third vehicle is discernible in the far distance, centered within the road. The surrounding environment consists of various buildings, with a multi-story structure featuring curved balconies on the immediate left, and a mix of residential-style and taller buildings further back and on the right. A large tree and landscaped hedges are visible on the right side of the road, adjacent to a smaller building. No pedestrians are clearly visible in the scene.

Driving Intent for frame 24: The ego's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, with its speed decreasing from 6.22 m/s to 0.67 m/s over the last 3 seconds, representing a total deceleration of 5.55 m/s, and a sharp deceleration rate of approximately 6.74 m/s^2 in the most recent 0.5 second. Concurrently, it was following the lane with negligible turning, indicated by curvature values mostly at 0.0 and a maximum of 0.006 to the right. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to stop at the stop line, it should continue to decelerate by 0.67 m/s to achieve a complete stop (0 m/s) within the next 0.5 seconds, and subsequently maintain this speed for the remaining duration of the 3-second period, as the traffic light state is unknown. The ego should continue following the lane with a curvature of 0.0.

Driving Intent for frame 26: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, coming to a near complete stop. Over the last 0.5 seconds, it decelerated by approximately 5.08 m/s^2, reducing its speed from 2.5418 m/s to 0.0024 m/s. Throughout the past 3 seconds, the ego vehicle was following the lane, as indicated by its curvature consistently remaining at or very close to 0.0. Taking into account that the ego vehicle is currently stopped at a stop line/crosswalk, and assuming it is safe to proceed given the clear crosswalk and the presence of other moving traffic, the ego should accelerate at approximately 2.0 m/s^2 in the next 3 seconds to smoothly move through the intersection. It should also continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of 0.0 radians/meter, as the road ahead appears straight.

Scene Description for frame 28: The scene displays a multi-lane urban street intersection under clear daylight conditions. In the immediate foreground, solid white lines define the start of the intersection or a crosswalk, with dashed white lines extending further down the road, delineating multiple lanes of traffic. An overhead gantry supports several traffic light signal heads across the width of the intersection, but their current illuminated state is unclear. On the left side of the road, a silver sedan is observed, appearing to be in motion or recently stopped, adjacent to multi-story buildings that line the street. Further ahead in the distance, two more vehicles, a light-colored sedan and a darker SUV, are visible in the lanes of travel, seemingly moving away from the viewer. A portion of a tan vehicle is also visible on the far right near the curb. The right side of the street features smaller buildings, a prominent large tree, and a hedge, contrasting with the taller, more modern buildings on the left. No pedestrians are distinctly visible in the immediate vicinity of the roadway.

Driving Intent for frame 28: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly, by approximately 6.23 m/s over 3 seconds, coming to a near complete stop with a final speed of 0.0008 m/s. Its lateral intent was predominantly following the lane, with a very slight turn to the right indicated by a curvature of -0.063 in the most recent 0.5-second interval before stopping. Taking into account that the ego vehicle has just come to a stop at an urban intersection, and assuming that conditions will allow for safe progression despite the unclear traffic light state (as there are no distinct pedestrians and vehicles in the distance are moving away), the ego should accelerate by approximately 2 m/s² for the next 3 seconds, gradually increasing its speed to around 6 m/s, and should follow the lane maintaining a curvature of 0.0 to proceed straight through the intersection.

Driving Intent for frame 2: The ego vehicle was accelerating from approximately 0 m/s to 2.94 m/s over the past 3 seconds, with the most recent acceleration increasing its speed by about 0.82 m/s. For curvature, it was largely following the lane, making a very minor rightward adjustment with a curvature of -0.03 around 1.5 seconds ago, before returning to a straight path. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and current low speed, it should continue to accelerate to reach a more appropriate speed for city driving while maintaining a safe following distance from the leading white sedan. The acceleration should be steady, similar to its recent rate, which would increase its speed to approximately 7.8 m/s within the next 3 seconds. It should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a curvature close to 0.0, as the road appears straight ahead.

Driving Intent for frame 0: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating significantly, increasing its speed from 0.49 m/s to 6.42 m/s over the past 2.5 seconds, which calculates to an average acceleration of approximately 2.37 m/s², with the most recent acceleration in the last 0.5 seconds being a strong 3.72 m/s². Concurrently, it was making minor steering adjustments, with its most recent intent being to turn right by approximately 0.055 curvature units. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the presence of a black SUV directly ahead in the rightmost lane, the ego should accelerate moderately by approximately 1.5 m/s² to smoothly increase speed and maintain a safe following distance from the lead vehicle, rather than continuing its previous strong acceleration. For steering, given the road's visual appearance and the ego's recent curvature, it should continue to turn right by approximately 0.055 curvature units to follow the subtle curve of the current lane.

Driving Intent for frame 2: The ego's previous intent was to accelerate significantly, with the acceleration increasing from approximately 1.86 m/s^2 to 3.70 m/s^2 in the last 0.5-second interval, resulting in a speed increase from 1.31 m/s to 7.08 m/s over the past 3 seconds. Concurrently, the ego was primarily following the lane with minor steering adjustments, exhibiting a slight right turn with a curvature of -0.019 in the most recent interval. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to gain speed, and considering the presence of a black SUV directly ahead in the current lane, the ego should accelerate by approximately 1.5 m/s^2 in the next 3 seconds to continue increasing its speed to a more appropriate level for the urban road while maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. For steering, the ego should follow the lane, maintaining a curvature of approximately 0, as the road appears straight and the prior minor right turn was likely a small correction.

Driving Intent for frame 4: The ego vehicle's previous intent was to decelerate significantly from an initial speed of approximately 1.73 m/s, accelerating briefly to 2.39 m/s before sharply decelerating by roughly 2.39 m/s over the last 2 seconds to reach a complete stop (current speed ~0 m/s). Concurrently, it was primarily following the lane, as indicated by the curvature values remaining very close to zero after an initial slight left turn of 0.043, ending with no turning. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene with red traffic signals and the vehicle stopped at the stop lines, for the next 3 seconds, the ego should maintain its current speed of 0 m/s, neither accelerating nor decelerating, and should continue to follow the lane by maintaining 0 curvature, as it awaits the traffic lights to change.

Driving Intent for frame 30: The ego vehicle's previous intent was accelerating, increasing its speed from a near standstill (0.2 m/s) to 2.17 m/s over the last 1.5 seconds, which indicates an average acceleration of approximately 1.3 m/s^2. Concurrently, it was following the lane with a very slight, almost imperceptible right turn, as indicated by the minor and decreasing negative curvature values. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, which shows red traffic lights and stop lines, the ego should decelerate significantly to a complete stop before the stop lines within the next 3 seconds. This will require decelerating by approximately 1.5 m/s^2 to safely come to a standstill from its current speed of 2.17 m/s. It should continue to follow the lane, maintaining a straight path, as there is no indication of a required turn.

Driving Intent for frame 30: The ego's previous intent was to decelerate from 1.426 m/s to a complete stop at 0.0 m/s, then it began accelerating, reaching 2.072 m/s at the most recent measurement, indicating it was accelerating by approximately 1.38 m/s² over the last 1.5 seconds from a standstill. Concurrently, it made a right turn with a curvature of -0.086 approximately 1 second ago, and is now almost driving straight with a curvature of -0.001. Taking into account the ego's previous intent to accelerate and straighten, combined with the current scene showing an empty intersection and illuminated yellow traffic lights, the ego vehicle should accelerate by approximately 1.5 m/s² to clear the intersection safely and smoothly, and it should follow the lane by maintaining a curvature near 0.

Driving Intent for frame 6: The ego's previous intent was accelerating, increasing its speed from 2.09 m/s to 8.17 m/s, an overall acceleration of approximately 6.08 m/s over 3 seconds, with the acceleration becoming more pronounced towards the end of the period. Simultaneously, the ego was following the lane, exhibiting very slight turns with a maximum absolute curvature of 0.005, and most recently a very minor turn to the right with a curvature of -0.001, effectively following the lane. Taking into account the ego's previous intent of acceleration towards the underpass, and considering the presence of a solid white stop line or pedestrian crossing line immediately ahead without any visible stop sign or pedestrians, the ego should maintain its current speed of approximately 8.17 m/s to cautiously approach and process the line, rather than continuing to accelerate. The ego should continue to follow the lane, which appears to be straight, with a curvature of approximately 0.0 into the underpass.

Driving Intent for frame 36: The ego's previous intent was to maintain speed, decelerating by approximately 0.02 m/s/s on average over the past 3 seconds, resulting in a total speed change of -0.05 m/s. Concurrently, it was turning left with a decreasing curvature from a peak of 0.036 to 0.0, indicating it was straightening out to follow the lane. Taking into account the ego's previous intent and the current scene, which includes an SUV ahead in the same lane, an approaching intersection with an indiscernible traffic light state, and hazy environmental conditions, the ego should moderately decelerate by approximately 0.2-0.3 m/s over the next 3 seconds to ensure a safe following distance and prepare for a potential stop. It should continue following the lane with a curvature of approximately 0.0, as the road appears straight.
